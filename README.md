## Changes and Improvements

### Initial Setup

- Created the basic structure of the landing page using HTML.
- Applied a basic CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
- Used flexbox for layout in the features section to evenly distribute content.

### Design and Layout

- Improved the header section with background color and text styling.
- Added a hero section with a background image, main headline, subheadline, and a call-to-action button.
- Ensured the hero section text is centered and stands out against the background image using CSS positioning and text-shadow.

### Features Section

- Added images and descriptive text for each feature.
- Used flexbox for responsive layout and spacing between features.
- Applied box-shadow and border-radius for a modern, card-like design.

### Testimonials Section

- Styled blockquotes for testimonials to visually separate them from other content.
- Added a border-left and padding for better readability and emphasis.

### Contact Section

- Created a contact form with name, email, and message fields.
- Styled form elements for a cohesive look and improved user experience.
- Added form validation using JavaScript to ensure all fields are filled out before submission.

### Footer

### Images

- Included relevant images for hero and feature sections to make the page visually appealing.

## Challenges Faced

- **Layout Issues**: Initially, the header and hero sections were overlapping. This was resolved by ensuring proper margins and padding between sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the page looks good on all devices required careful use of flexbox and media queries.
